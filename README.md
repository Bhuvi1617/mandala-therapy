## ✨ Day 2 of Sharing: Introducing Mandala Therapy

You know how most of us have those incomplete projects sitting in the local folders of our laptops...  
well, I have many.

I’m now going to start pushing them online — not only to present them to people but also to fix the issues in them and possibly enhance them.

## ✨ Background

I truly believe mandala drawing can be a therapeutic activity with multiple benefits.  
Pairing it with music just changes the game.

I have a few mandala drawings with me and will continue to draw more — hence, this fun cozy space was born 😄

## 🛠 Tech Stack and Project Details

This is a **frontend-only** project with API calls to [ZenQuotes.io](https://zenquotes.io).  
Built entirely using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.

I’d recommend checking it out — you’ll find a bunch of simple yet calming features:

- 🌸 You can colour the Mandala of the day!
- 🌸 Write affirmations for yourself, that get saved in your browser.
- 🌸 Browse my gallery with some soothing background music.
- 🌸 Switch between themes, and breathe along with the pulsating CSS element.
